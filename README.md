# Apple Financial Analysis (2009-2024)

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Apple Inc.'s financial performance from 2009 to 2024. It includes visualizations and statistical insights into various financial metrics such as revenue, net income, stock price, profitability, and more. The analysis covers key financial trends, growth rates, and forecasts, helping to understand Apple's financial health and business performance.

## Project Overview

The analysis explores the following key areas:

1. **Gross Margin Analysis**: Tracks Apple's profitability over time.
2. **Debt and Assets Analysis**: Analyzes Apple's financial stability by examining its total assets, liabilities, and long-term debt.
3. **Employee Growth**: Shows the expansion or reduction of Apple's workforce over the years.
4. **Stock Price vs EPS and Net Income**: Compares Apple's stock price, EPS (Earnings Per Share), and Net Income to understand investor sentiment and performance.
5. **Year-on-Year Growth Rates**: Calculates and visualizes the growth rates for revenue and net income.
6. **Key Financial Ratios**: Calculates important financial ratios such as Debt-to-Equity and Return on Equity (ROE) to assess financial leverage and performance.
7. **Multi-dimensional Correlation Analysis**: Investigates the relationships between key financial metrics using a correlation matrix.
8. **Cash Flow Analysis**: Examines the trends in Apple's cash reserves and liquidity over the years.
9. **Market Valuation Metrics**: Analyzes Apple's Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio to understand its market valuation.
10. **Operational Efficiency**: Looks at operational metrics such as EBITDA Margin and Operating Margin to evaluate Apple's efficiency.
11. **Stock Price Projection**: Uses linear regression to project Apple's stock price for the years 2025â€“2030.
12. **Trend Decomposition**: Breaks down the revenue trend to understand the impact of long-term trends, seasonality, and residuals.
13. **Profitability Analysis**: Analyzes various profitability margins including Gross, Operating, and Net Profit Margins.
14. **Revenue Forecasting**: Uses ARIMA model to forecast Apple's future revenue from 2025 to 2030.
15. **Rolling Averages**: Calculates and visualizes rolling averages to smooth out short-term fluctuations in revenue and net income.
